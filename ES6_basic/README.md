# ES6 Basics

## Description

This project introduces and explores the features of ECMAScript 6 (ES6), providing practical exercises to solidify your understanding. You will use modern JavaScript syntax and features, such as `let`/`const`, arrow functions, rest/spread operators, and template literals. Additionally, the project enforces code quality using ESLint and requires testing with Jest.
