# Techium HTML Project

## 📌 Description
Welcome to this project! The goal is to learn how to structure a web page using only HTML tags. No CSS or styling will be applied, so don’t worry if the page looks “raw” – that’s intentional.

⚠️ **Important Note:** Pay attention to details! Differences in uppercase vs lowercase letters and typos can affect your code.
